# webdev
Learning web development one step at a time.

This will serve as a guide to understanding web development from the basics of how HTML works to front-end frameworks and beyond. This is not not intended to take the place of any number of comprehensive courses and guides out there, such as from Mozilla, W3 schools, and many others.

Learning is a different expierence for everyone, but one thing that always helps is additional examples and different wording and phrasing of a concept. That's our goal. As this gets developed there will be fresh examples presented as clearly as possible (including why, not just the how), and always linking to more resources and guides.
