    <h1>How words on websites are organized: HTML</h1>
    <p>If you've read something on the internet before, you've looked at the result of HTML, congratulations! To see
        what that means, right-click on this text and choose "Inspect Element" from the menu. The current page is as
        simple as possible for clarity. You see an "h1" (heading 1) in brackets, and a "p" (paragraph) in brackets. For
        those old enough to remember newspapers, same idea with a heading and body text. Your browsers like Chrome,
        Firefox and Safari have lots of code to know what to do about these funny backet letters. <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" target="_blank">There's lots of them</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Throughout these web dev bits, you'll get a works cited, and you'll get an often musically based arbitrary
        example to see real code running.</p>
